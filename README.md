# JS Music Player
An Beautiful JavaScript music player made by [ChatGPT](https://ai.com)
----------
### Introduction
After the public introduction of GBT Chat, its remarkable ability to write code (especially JavaScript) received much attention.
To test the ability of this AI-based chatbot, I decided to make an attractive and efficient music player with the help of ChatGPT and have minimal involvement in changing its codes.
### How i made it?
The design that I envisioned at the beginning of its construction was something similar to the Samsung Music software. Then I asked the chatbot to make a player similar to it but using JavaScript language.

The result was amazing ‚ùó‚ùó
The music player code worked, it just had bugs in replaying or pausing and restarting the song.
Finally, with a lot of talking, I got the bot to understand how to change its code. And again, its understanding of code interpretation surprised me. üòÆ
Finally, I asked it to make it more beautiful by writing CSS codes. In order to reach the design I wanted, I sent several rewrite requests until finally that presented the existing design.
